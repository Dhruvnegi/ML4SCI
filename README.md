# ML4SCI

We are pleased to announce the **Machine Learning for Science (ML4SCI) Hackathon Competition** that will take place virtually from **October 26-30, 2020**. The competition is sponsored by the University of Alabama Cyber Initiative and the Brown Data Science Initiative and is open to anyone interested. The hackathon will focus on applying **machine learning** techniques to scientific challenges, including those from the fields of physics, astronomy, planetary science and geoscience.

The agenda for the hackathon can be found here: https://indico.cern.ch/event/966872/ 

Anyone interested in learning more about machine learning techniques and trying their hand at the competition is welcome. The **kickoff Zoom meeting** is on **Monday, 26 October at 4 PM US Central Time (5PM EDT)**. There will also be an introductory machine learning lecture by Prof. Harrison Prosper (FSU) on Tuesday, 27 October at 1:30 PM Central.

Interested participants can register via Slack at https://bit.ly/3noij1V. 

There are six main challenges:

* Higgs Boson Challenge (Classification, General)

* Particle Images Challenge (Classification, Computer Vision)

* Strong Lensing Challenge (Anomaly Detection)

* NMR Spin Challenge (Multi-Target Regression)

* Cosmic Rays in Planetary Science Images (Image Segmentation)

* Google Earth Engine Challenge (Anomaly Detection)

Please find more details and example Jupyter notebooks inside each challenge folder.

Solutions are due on Friday, Oct 30 at 7pm EDT/6pm Central time. Winners will receive certificates and prizes. For any questions about the ML4SCI Hackathon please contact Prof. Sergei Gleyzer [sgleyzer@ua.edu](mailto:sgleyzer@ua.edu)
